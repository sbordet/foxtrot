Welcome to Foxtrot, the easy API for the Java(TM) Foundation
Classes (JFC/Swing).

Foxtrot is bundled in a compressed file, that
contains documentation, examples, libraries and source code,
readable both from Unix, Linux and Windows machines.

The structure of the compressed file is as follows:

/docs    contains the documentation
/lib     contains the Foxtrot jars: core jar, the examples jar 
         and the source jar

Refer to the included documentation for further details on how 
to use the Foxtrot API.
