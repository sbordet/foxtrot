Welcome to Foxtrot, the easy API for the Java(TM) Foundation
Classes (JFC/Swing).

Foxtrot is bundled in a compressed file, that
contains javadoc documentation, examples, libraries and source code,
readable both from Unix, Linux and Windows machines.

The structure of the compressed file is as follows:

/docs    contains the documentation
/lib     contains the Foxtrot jars: core jar, the examples jar 
         and the source jar

The core jar is foxtrot.jar and should be added to the classpath.

For example, if a Swing application is contained in myapp.jar 
(and uses Foxtrot), then the command line to start would be similar 
to this one:

> java -classpath foxtrot.jar;myapp.jar my.app.Main


Refer to the documentation on the web site (http://foxtrot.sourceforge.net) 
for further details on how to use the Foxtrot API.
