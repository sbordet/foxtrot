Welcome to Foxtrot, the easy API for the Java(TM) Foundation
Classes (JFC/Swing).

INTRODUCTION

Foxtrot is bundled in a compressed file, that contains 
javadoc documentation, examples, libraries, tests and source code,
readable both from Unix, Linux and Windows machines.

The structure of the compressed file is as follows:

docs/    contains the documentation
lib/     contains the Foxtrot jars: core jar, the examples jar 
         and the source jar

The core jar is lib/foxtrot.jar and must be included in the classpath.
It is no longer necessary, from Foxtrot version 1.2, to include 
foxtrot.jar in the boot classpath. 
This way, Foxtrot is compatible with Java Web Start.

The docs/ directory contains the Foxtrot API in Javadoc format.

The distribution root directory contains this file and the BSD license.


USAGE

If a Swing application is contained in myapp.jar and uses Foxtrot, 
then the command line to start it would be similar to this one (in Windows):

> java -cp foxtrot.jar;myapp.jar my.app.Main


EXAMPLES

To run the examples included in the distribution, use the following 
command line (from the distribution root directory):

> java -cp lib\foxtrot.jar;lib\foxtrot-examples.jar foxtrot.examples.SimpleExample
> java -cp lib\foxtrot.jar;lib\foxtrot-examples.jar foxtrot.examples.InterruptExample


TESTS

From Foxtrot version 2.0, tests are based on JUnit 3.8.1.
