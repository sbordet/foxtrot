Welcome to Foxtrot, the easy API for the Java(TM) Foundation
Classes (JFC/Swing).

Foxtrot is bundled in a compressed file, that
contains javadoc documentation, examples, libraries and source code,
readable both from Unix, Linux and Windows machines.

The structure of the compressed file is as follows:

/docs    contains the documentation
/lib     contains the Foxtrot jars: core jar, the examples jar 
         and the source jar

The core jar is foxtrot.jar and, from Foxtrot version 1.1, must be 
included in the boot classpath.

For example, if a Swing application is contained in myapp.jar 
(and uses Foxtrot), then the command line to start would be similar 
to this one:

> java -Xbootclasspath/a:foxtrot.jar -classpath myapp.jar my.app.Main


Refer to the documentation on the web site for further details on how 
to use the Foxtrot API.
