/**
 * Full implementation of {@link foxtrot.WorkerThread} that uses one or more threads to run
 * {@link foxtrot.Task}s subclasses. <br />
 * Tasks execution is parallelized: two tasks posted at the same time are executed in parallel
 * by two different threads.
 * This is done by using a mechanism similar to a classic web server threading: one thread
 * waits for incoming tasks and a new thread is spawned to run the task.
 * This ensures that the {@link #postTask} method returns immediately in any case.
