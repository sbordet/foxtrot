Welcome to Foxtrot, the easy API for the Java(TM) Foundation
Classes (JFC/Swing).

Foxtrot is bundled in a compressed file, that
contains javadoc documentation, examples, libraries and source code,
readable both from Unix, Linux and Windows machines.

The structure of the compressed file is as follows:

/docs    contains the documentation
/lib     contains the Foxtrot jars: core jar, the examples jar 
         and the source jar

The core jar is foxtrot.jar and must be included in the classpath.
It is no longer necessary, from Foxtrot version 1.2, to include 
foxtrot.jar in the boot classpath, thanks to a patch contributed 
by Dan Holmsand (dan@eyebee.com). 
This way, Foxtrot is compatible with Java Web Start.

For example, if a Swing application is contained in myapp.jar 
(and uses Foxtrot), then the command line to start would be similar 
to this one (in Windows):

> java -classpath foxtrot.jar;myapp.jar my.app.Main


Refer to the documentation on the web site (http://foxtrot.sourceforge.net) 
for further details on how to use the Foxtrot API.
