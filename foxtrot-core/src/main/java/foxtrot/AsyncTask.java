/**
 * A time-consuming task to be executed asynchronously by {@link AsyncWorker}. <br />
 * Users must implement the {@link #run} method as they would do with Task. <br />
 * Exceptions and Errors thrown by the <tt>run()</tt> method will <strong>not</strong>
 * be rethrown automatically by {@link AsyncWorker#post(AsyncTask)}. <br />
 * Instead, two callbacks are provided to handle the successful run of the task or
 * its failure, respectively {@link #success(Object)} and {@link #failure(Throwable)},
 * both called in the Event Dispatch Thread when the task is finished. <br />
 * AsyncTasks cannot be reused, that is, it is not safe to pass the same instance to
 * two consecutive calls to {@link AsyncWorker#post(AsyncTask)}. <br />
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * AsyncTask task = new AsyncTask()
 * {
 *     public Object run() throws Exception
 *     {
 *         // Called in a worker thread
 *         Thread.sleep(1000);
 *         return new ArrayList();
 *     }
 *
 *     public void success(Object result)
 *     {
 *         // Called in the Event Dispatch Thread
 *         List result = (List)result;
 *         // Do something with the List
 *     }
 *     public void failure(Throwable x)
 *     {
 *         // Report exception to the user, or just log it
 *     }
 * });
 * </pre>
